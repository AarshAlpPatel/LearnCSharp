# LearnCSharp

This repository contains the code I wrote (no AI!!) to learn the language of C#
This will be a three step process:
1) Use C# to create solutions to AdventOfCode Challenges
2) Use C# to recreate Web Connections from scratch
3) Use C# to create an Adhiveshan Proctors Logistics Scheduler
